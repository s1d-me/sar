                <div id="info-page" class="page-content">
                    <h2>More Info About Me</h2>
                    <p>I am Sarthak Sidhant, I like technology. and that's all that to say about me. if there is, i can't put it into words myself.
                        <p class="additional-info">my last social interaction was with my homelab server</p>
                        <br>
                        I like programming because i get to make things i like, and i get to solve problems. I like to make software that breaks more often, (because i get to be on my lovely computer to fix them) I like to make bad looking websites. I like to atleast be a little creative, and I like doing things for the sake of me. (narcissist much?)
                        <br><br>
                        Someone smart would call it impulse. I call it obsession, I am obsessed with me. so all the things i make, or have ever made, I felt the need to do that because I wanted to see that change.
                        <p class="additional-info">One could argue that, "well you clearly aren't self centered with go-cattle huh", yeah shit sherlock - I AM A COW. MOOOO.</p>
                        I was destined to do something related to computers, Both my parents were "computer engineers" when personal computers were launched in india, I had the experience of using the internet when a huge population of India had no access to it, I was using a mouse at 3 months old (atleast that's what my mother tells me), making official letters on MS Word at 6, and learning to code HTML websites at 9. 
                        <br>
                        <p class="additional-info"> A little too early for everything, but I have always been like that. So "How did I get into coding" questions, here's your straightforward answer: I got into computers, I got into Technology in general, and I wanted to make my own things. Learnt HTML and CSS by 12 on random youtube tutorials, Learnt Python at 13 and then took help from whoever I could. The Digital Realm is a big big space.</p>
                        <br>
                        I am still an average developer, I make random people on the internet (and recently Gemini-2.5-Pro) do all my work /jk, it makes things very easy for me. my code is not readable by many, people are as confused as I am when they learn about my projects. I think my projects only work because they are as confused as i am.
                        <p class ="additional-info"> and no i don't manage my time, I suck with that. the last time i studied for 2 hours continuously was 2 years ago. I can't learn something I am not passionate about. (eg: Organic Chemistry for JEE Mains)</p>
                        Yeah that's pretty much about me, I like chess sometimes, and when I am not on computer, I am either sleeping or thinking.
                        <br>
                        but again, since I believe people are just a bunch of thoughts, here are mine, summed up by redstalk, the reddit profiler:

                        content: 'â€¢'; /* Unicode bullet character */
                        position: absolute;
                        left: 0;
                        top: 0;

                        line-height: inherit; /* Align with text */
                        }

                        .points li:hover {
                        color: #1fd655; /* A slightly darker blue on hover */
}
                     </style>
                     <ul class="points">
                        <li>I have an endless desire for self expression. This is why I try to give all interviews I can. and am writing this at 12:51 AM on a sunday night.</li>
                        <li>I think am very Opinionated and Assertive online, but I do sometimes lack confidence to say that clearly in real life, probably because the internet persona has given me the power to say anything I want, to anyone I want without repurcussions, but the same doesn't follow in real life.</li>
                        <li>I do lack a belief system, that is you could call me an atheist. I now have a very rational approach of living life and thinking. I have never really believed in the bullshit my ancestors came up with (rationally albeit) 3 thousand years ago, but I think we should have a progressive view, and yeah science good. change good.</li>
                        <li>Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. Freedom of Everything (some regulation sure) until you encroach on someone's freedom.</li>
                        <li>No, I do not like religions. I do think it is a tool to control a large sect of society. I think culture can exist without religions, and Culture isn't that bad afterall. Every system needs some change.</li>
                        <li>I do try my best to uphold free speech, especially when provided with power. "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to death your right to say it" Until it gets into the territory of super-harassment, I think there should be repurcussions for the People with high Popularity on what they speak though.</li>
                        <li>I am known as the Mettle Bottle Man on Reddit. (you can search up "METTLE BOTTLE REDDIT" on google), This is partly because I lost my bottle and posted "missing" posters of my bottle in majority of india subreddits and they got quite popular, this shows im really attached to my mettle bottle (sorry for that humor)</li>
                        <li>I do not come from the homogametic sex (the females) but I do have severe mood swings, and i am very impulsive. I do things at the heat of the moment because I like doing them, i might repent doing them later</li>
                        <li>I was raised by the internet. I am the Internet's kid. Blame it on the internet</li>
                        <li>I am who I am. I won't change myself for you or present a multifaceted "dogla"/"twoface", I would be kind, and accepting of your opinion, and thoughts, even if they go against the core idea of mine (important: don't encroach other's freedom)</li>
                        <li>I do express a disillusionment with society in general, I express skepticism towards instutiions, I emphasize on critical thinking, I believe in a human being's potential, and Redstalk thinks I strong support "social justice", whatever that is.</li>
                        <li>Humor is my coping mechanism</li>
                        <li> I tried getting more social in the past days and I am not an imtrovert anymore tho. But my idea of society is very french revolution, so I can't really talk with the opposite sex as of right now (call me an incel go ahead)</li>
                        <li> Oh and I hate the idea of centralization, necessary evil, much? </li>
                     </ul>
                        
                        <p class="additional-info">That's the deepest I could express myself. Thanks for your time.</p>

Then a symptom based classification model was made, and the entire project was called go-cattle. we came third :( biased judges tbh (lmao im a crybaby) anyway, so yeah that's it, we were approved by a vet doctor w 30 years of experience in the government btw</p>
